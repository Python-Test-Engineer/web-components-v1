Here&#8217;s what he came up with in his&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/evaluation.htm\">doctoral dissertation</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I had comments from well over 500 developers, many of whom were distinguished engineers with decades of experience, and I had to explain everything from the most abstract notions of Web interaction to the finest details of HTTP syntax.&nbsp;<strong>That process honed my model down to a core set of principles, properties, and constraints that are now called REST.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n<h2>What makes an API RESTful?</h2>\n<p><b>So what do these mean?</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Uniform interface: </strong>This means we use HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE). We use URIs as our resources. And we get an HTTP response with a status and a body.</li>\n<li><strong>Stateless.</strong> This means each request is self-descriptive, and has enough context for the server to process that message.</li>\n<li><strong>Client-server.:</strong>There has to be clear boundaries between roles of the two two systems. One server, operationally, <em>has</em> to function as the server that is being called, and the other <em>has</em> to function as the one making the requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Cacheable: </strong>Unless denoted, a client can cache any representation. This is possible thanks to the statelessness—every representation is self-descriptive.</li>\n<li><b>Layered System: </b>A Layered System employs several independent layers to develop and extend the interface. As layers cannot see into each other, new requests and middleware can be inserted that will not have an impact on the initial commands and the client-server functioning.  Thus if the bits in the middle change, the client still only needs the original URL to fulfil its request.</li>\n<li><b>Code on demand: </b>This is optional and just means client can change its code as it wishes and is independent of the server logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IN ESSENCE</strong></p>\n<p>If we are using HTTP and URLs then our APIs are essentially RESTful in spirit if not by letter.</p>\n<p>As far as our clients are concerned, they just need to know the URL and parameters to get data in a known format and know that whatever changes take place in the middle or at the server, they need not change their code.</p>",
