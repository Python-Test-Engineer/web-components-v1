# Build a Framework-less Web App with ES7 and Web Components

JavaScript in the browser has evolved. Developers who want to take advantage of the latest features have the option of going framework-less with less hassle. Functionally normally reserved to front-end frameworks, like a component-based approach, is now feasible in plain old JavaScript.

This repo contains code for a demo app (an author data list) which showcases many of these techniques.
